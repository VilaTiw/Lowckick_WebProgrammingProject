### CS Search Engine

## ROADMAP:
1. Finish Azure deploying with CI/CD    ///Still need to finish deploying and fixing deploy bug(check debuging block) :heavy_exclamation_mark:
2. SteamAPI connecting    ///Need to learn more about SteamAPI and viewall request to get all needed info :white_check_mark:
3. Database establishing    ///After gettting along with API, i need to create a functionality to save&update mongodb database :white_check_mark:
4. Creating search engine    /// Must create a base search engine for a future establishing  :soon:
5. Configurating engine for our purposes    ///Created for CS skins, must work with them, some search algorithm and sites rating will be needed ðŸ”²:
6. Creating a better and unique design ///After finishing backend it will important to create design for a site :white_check_mark:

## README:
Right now there is a bug or code problem with deploying, but you can still launch it on your local host. Just launch code in your chosen environment and it will get it done and will give you localhost link(default localhost:5000)


## DEBUGING:
Need to deploy it at least somewhere. There is a problem with that, it`s just didn`t launching. Will optimize code and files, check it again. If still won`t be working, should thing about something else. Maybe swithcing to Jango, not sure yet.
Right now project is deployed to Heroku, just to be sure it`s working(spoiler:it is). 

## DEVBLOG:
This is student project associated with my hobby(CS:GO skins and its market). Right now its in early development stage, but it must be a kind of search engine/items  
database(aint sure about balance yet). 

28.03.23 It`s written on Python Flask framework + MongoDB. Should be deployed on Azure, but some problems was met, so right now it is deployed on heroku.

29-30.03.23 Learned a bit about Steam Api, used it to collect info about 100 market items, insert it into mongodb and configure to be shown on web-site.
Configure Gunicorn for Heroku deployment.

11.04.23 Ended resource limits for Heroku, but project was updated, so i think it will work better on other deployment services. Finished with steam auth info, trying dmarketAPI and working on better style

04.05.23 Established database view from dmarketAPI and getting info from api url. Decided to get only dmarketAPI info.

## Technology used for now:
1. Python
2. MongoDB
3. Visual Code
4. Azure
5. pymongo
6. Heroku
7. Gunicorn
8. Steam API
